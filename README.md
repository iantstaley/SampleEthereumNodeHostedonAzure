# SampleEthereumNodeHostedonAzure
An example code snippet in JavaScript that demonstrates how to interact with an Ethereum node hosted on Azure using web3.js.
Integrating Ethereum and Azure involves several steps, including setting up an Ethereum node, configuring a private network, and deploying smart contracts. Here's a high-level overview of the process:

Set up an Ethereum node: You can set up an Ethereum node on Azure using services like Azure Blockchain Service or Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

Configure a private network: Once you have set up an Ethereum node, you can configure a private network by creating a new network ID and setting up the Genesis file.

Deploy smart contracts: With your Ethereum node and private network configured, you can now deploy smart contracts using tools like Remix, Truffle, or Solidity.

Interact with smart contracts: Once you have deployed your smart contracts, you can interact with them using web3.js or other Ethereum development tools.

Note: This is just a simple example to demonstrate how to interact with Ethereum using Azure and web3.js. In a real-world scenario, you would need to take care of security considerations and handle errors appropriately.
